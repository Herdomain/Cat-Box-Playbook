# CAT-BOX-PLAYBOOK

## Executive Summary

This project involved creating a data breach response playbook for Box Manufacturing, following the NIST Incident Response Lifecycle and CISA guidance. The goal was to support fast and coordinated actions between internal teams and a third-party security provider (Cat) during a breach. The playbook includes a communication plan, stakeholder roles, and a clear escalation workflow based on incident impact, data exposure, and regulatory requirements.

Two separate communication templates were prepared—one technical letter for the MSSP and one simplified update for the company’s CEO. The workflow also includes specific triggers to escalate based on severity, system impact, or unresolved issues. This approach ensures timely response, legal compliance, and business continuity.

## Objective

The objective of this project was to develop an incident response playbook for a data breach scenario affecting a small company with limited in-house security resources. The playbook defines response steps, stakeholder roles, escalation triggers, and communication strategies. It was designed to help the company respond quickly, protect sensitive data, and meet regulatory obligations.

### Skills Learned

- Built a playbook using NIST and CISA standards
- Developed role-based escalation workflows for incident response
- Wrote technical and non-technical incident reports tailored to stakeholders
- Aligned security procedures with compliance requirements (e.g., CCPA)
- Practiced translating threat indicators into actionable business decisions

### Tools & Technologies Used

- NIST Incident Response Lifecycle
- CISA Playbook Guidances
- MITRE ATT&CK (For escalation scenarios)
- Workflow diagrams (Incident response flow and stakeholder matrix)
