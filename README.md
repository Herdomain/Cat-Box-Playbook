# 📘 Incident Response Playbook – Data Breach (Cat & Box Scenario)

## 📝 Executive Summary

This project involved creating a data breach response playbook for Box Manufacturing, using the NIST Incident Response Lifecycle and guidance from CISA. The playbook is designed to support quick and coordinated actions between the internal SOC team and an external MSSP (Cat). It includes response workflows, communication templates, and clear escalation procedures based on the type and impact of the incident.

The playbook also includes a technical incident report for security professionals and a simplified summary for executive leadership, ensuring effective communication at all levels. Escalation criteria were based on risk factors such as data sensitivity, legal impact, scope of the incident, and incident duration.

## 🔄 Steps Taken

1. Read the incident scenario to understand stakeholder roles and communication needs  
2. Selected "data breach" as the incident type based on sensitivity and business impact  
3. Identified escalation triggers using NIST and CISA guidance (e.g., data compromise, duration)  
4. Built a stakeholder matrix to define who gets involved, when, and why  
5. Wrote a technical incident letter for the third-party MSSP  
6. Wrote a non-technical summary letter for the CEO to explain the situation clearly  
7. Designed an incident response workflow covering detection, escalation, and containment  
8. Finalized the playbook with all workflows, templates, and decision points aligned to real-world response goals
