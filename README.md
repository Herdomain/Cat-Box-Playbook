# 📘 Incident Response Playbook – Data Breach (Cat & Box Scenario)

## 📝 Executive Summary

This project involved creating a data breach response playbook for Box Manufacturing, using the NIST Incident Response Lifecycle and guidance from CISA. The playbook is designed to support quick and coordinated actions between the internal SOC team and an external MSSP (Cat). It includes response workflows, communication templates, and clear escalation procedures based on the type and impact of the incident.

The playbook also includes a technical incident report for security professionals and a simplified summary for executive leadership, ensuring effective communication at all levels. Escalation criteria were based on risk factors such as data sensitivity, legal impact, scope of the incident, and incident duration.

## 🔄 Project Steps

1. **Scenario Review**: Read and analyzed the provided scenario details  
2. **Incident Type Selection**: Chose data breach as the primary threat  
3. **Stakeholder Identification**: Defined roles for Cat, Dusty, Percy, Misha, and others  
4. **Communication Templates**: Wrote incident letters for third-party and executive use  
5. **Workflow Development**: Mapped incident steps using the NIST framework  
6. **Escalation Logic**: Justified decision-making based on six key risk factors:
   - Severity of impact  
   - Legal and regulatory obligations  
   - Threat nature and persistence  
   - Incident scope  
   - Duration of the issue  
   - Confirmed data compromise  
7. **Final Deliverables**: Playbook document, workflow diagram, stakeholder matrix, and letters
